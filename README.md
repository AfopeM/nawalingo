## Project Synopsis

Nawalingo is an innovative **pay-per-lesson language learning platform** designed to connect students with qualified tutors for live, one-on-one video sessions. Students can easily book 60-minute lessons, benefit from discounted lesson packages, and access recorded replays of their sessions for convenient review. Tutors are empowered to manage their profiles, set their availability, and receive bi-weekly payouts securely. The platform features a seamless experience, allowing users to effortlessly **switch between student and tutor roles** within a single account. Administrative tools are in place to oversee tutor applications, monitor platform activity, and ensure adherence to community guidelines.

**MVP Focus:** The initial release of Nawalingo is sharply focused on a streamlined, direct learning experience. **Group classes, gamification features (like streaks), and AI-based tutor matching are explicitly excluded** in this phase, prioritizing the core live 1:1 interaction.
